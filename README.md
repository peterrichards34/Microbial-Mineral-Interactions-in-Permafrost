# Microbial-Mineral-Interactions-in-Permafrost
## Synthetic data utilizing induced polarization and forward modelling methods to assess microbe-minereal interactions in the face of permafrost ##
### The following is a forward simulation using synthetic data to analyze microbe-mineral interactions motivated by the recent and continued release of microbes from the permafrost as the permafrost melts at increasing rates. ###
