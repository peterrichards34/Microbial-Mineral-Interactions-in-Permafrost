# Microbial-Mineral-Interactions-in-Permafrost
## Synthetic data utilizing induced polarization and forward modelling methods to assess microbe-minereal interactions in the face of permafrost ##
### Definition of Research Question: Can induced polarization effectively detect and characterize microbial-driven mineral transformations occurring in permafrost systems? Overview of Methods and Open-Source Software: Microbial-Geochemical Modeling: Use PHREEQC (U.S. Geological Survey open-source software) to simulate biogeochemical processes such as microbial sulfate reduction, iron oxidation, and mineral precipitation (e.g., iron sulfides, iron oxyhydroxides). Incorporate microbial kinetics and thermodynamics from available literature. Geophysical Forward Modeling and Inversion: PyGIMLi (Python Geophysical Inversion and Modeling Library), open-source library for forward modeling and inversion of induced polarization and electrical resistivity data. (Simpeg works as well) Use PyGIMLi to generate synthetic IP datasets based on PHREEQC outputs (i.e., mineral precipitation and electrolyte changes). Sensitivity Analysis: Implement sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using Python libraries (SALib, NumPy, SciPy) to quantify the geophysical detectability of microbial-mineral interactions under various environmental conditions. Visualization and Interpretation: Use open-source visualization software (ParaView, Matplotlib) for comprehensive 2D/3D visualization and interpretation of IP responses in relation to microbial-geochemical processes. Identification of Data Sets (Motivation/Inversion): Literature-sourced field studies of AMD sites highlighting IP responses to microbial-driven reactions and mineral transformations (e.g., biogenic iron sulfides, iron oxyhydroxides). Published microbial growth rates, mineral precipitation kinetics, and associated geochemical conditions as inputs to synthetic models (parameter motivation and calibration). Defined Goals: Develop synthetic IP datasets illustrating distinctive microbial-mineral interaction signatures in AMD scenarios. Quantify detectability thresholds, identifying microbial-geochemical parameters with the strongest IP influence. Provide clear criteria for geophysically differentiating abiotic versus microbial-driven mineral precipitation. ## ###
